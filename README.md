## Key Features

###Intro
* Use your own remixed URL to fetch results inside of your project to perform RESTful API requests, it should look 
  like:[MOVIES](https://your-random-url.glitch.me/movies.)  

### Loading
* When the page loads, a loading message will appear
* This will be helpful because it will allow time for the browser to fetch the JSONfile and come back with the 
  information presented. 
* By the time the JSON data is displayed, the page loader will then fade
### Allow users to add new movies
* A form should be pre-populated with the selected movie's details (edit)
* Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead your javascript code should make an ajax 
  request when the form is submitted. (edit)
